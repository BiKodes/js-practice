// JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) is a standard text-based format for representing structured 
// data based on JavaScript object syntax.
// It is commonly used for transmitting data in web applications 
// (e.g., sending some data from the server to the client, so it can be displayed on a web page, 
// or vice versa). 

// Converting a string to a native object is called deserialization, 
// Converting a native object to a string so it can be transmitted across the network is called serialization.

// JSON is purely a data format â€” it contains only properties, no methods.
// JSON requires double quotes to be used around strings and property names. 
// Single quotes are not valid.
// Even a single misplaced comma or colon can cause a JSON file to go wrong, and not work. 


// Converting between objects and text:

// Built-in JSON object is available in browsers, which contains the following two methods:

// parse(): Accepts a JSON string as a parameter, and returns the corresponding JavaScript object.
// stringify(): Accepts an object as a parameter, and returns the equivalent JSON string form.
